# Algo-Coach

Algo-Coach is an interactive training platform designed to help students learn how to think through competitive programming problems, especially for USACO-style contests.

Most platforms give problems and solutions.
Algo-Coach focuses on teaching:
- how to recognize problem types
- how to model problems before coding
- how to analyze constraints
- how to avoid common mistakes

---

## Core Idea

Before coding, users are guided to:
1. Classify the problem
2. Identify key variables and state
3. Choose appropriate data structures
4. Estimate time complexity
5. List possible edge cases

This builds real problem-solving ability instead of memorization.

## Phase 1 Goals (Frontend MVP)

- Problem library (metadata + links)
- Lesson engine
- Model-Before-Code workflow
- Hint ladder system
- Drill mode for pattern recognition
- Bronze curriculum first

---

## Non-Goals (for now)

- Full solutions for every problem
- Heavy backend infrastructure
- Leaderboards or social features

---

## Long-Term Vision

Algo-Coach will become a structured training system that teaches algorithmic thinking through guided reasoning, drills, and interactive lessons.

---

## Roadmap

Phase 1:
Frontend + lessons + drills

Phase 2:
Backend + progress tracking + analytics

Phase 3:
Community features + expanded curriculum

---

## Target Users

- Competitive programming students across multiple skill levels
- USACO Bronze, Silver, and Gold participants
- Students learning algorithmic thinking and problem-solving
- Anyone preparing for programming contests
