# Algo-Coach

Algo-Coach is an interactive training platform designed to help students learn how to think through competitive programming problems, especially for USACO-style contests.

Most platforms give problems and solutions.
Algo-Coach focuses on teaching:
- how to recognize problem types
- how to model problems before coding
- how to analyze constraints
- how to avoid common mistakes

Work in progress at the moment.
