# Lesson Schema

Lessons in Algo-Coach follow a consistent structure so they can be rendered dynamically in the frontend.

Each lesson should teach one concept clearly and guide the user through reasoning before coding.

## Lesson Sections

1. Problem Summary  
A short explanation of the problem in your own words.

2. Model Before Code Questions  
Questions that guide the student to think before coding:
- What type of problem is this?
- What variables define the state?
- What data structures are useful?
- What is the expected time complexity?
- What edge cases might break a solution?

3. Hint Ladder  
A sequence of progressive hints:
- Hint 1: Directional guidance
- Hint 2: More concrete guidance
- Hint 3: Key insight

4. Common Mistakes  
Examples:
- Off-by-one errors
- Wrong loop bounds
- Forgetting to reset variables

5. Explanation  
Clear explanation of the reasoning and approach.

    "What category does this problem fall into?",
    "What variables define the state of the system?",
    "What data structures could represent this state?",
    "What is the expected time complexity?",
    "What edge cases might cause bugs?"
  ],

  "hints": [

## Design Principles

- Lessons should be concise
- Focus on reasoning, not just code
- Avoid long editorials
- Teach patterns that transfer to other problems
