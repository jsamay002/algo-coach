# Commit Rules

To keep the project organized and professional, follow these commit guidelines.

---

## General Rules

- Make small, focused commits
- One feature or change per commit when possible
- Write clear commit messages
- Commit frequently

---

## Commit Message Format

Prefix types:

feat: new feature  
fix: bug fix  
docs: documentation changes  
chore: setup or cleanup  
refactor: code restructuring  
style: formatting or UI changes  

---

## Examples

feat: add lesson renderer  
feat: implement drill mode UI  
fix: correct lesson navigation bug  
docs: update PRD  
chore: create project structure

## Commit Frequency Goal

During active development:
- 3–5 commits per work session
- Consistent commits over time are better than large commits
