# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Name
Algo-Coach

---

## Overview

Algo-Coach is an interactive training platform designed to help students learn how to think through competitive programming problems, especially those found in USACO and similar contests.

Most platforms provide problems and solutions. Algo-Coach focuses on teaching the reasoning process before coding.

---

## Problem Statement

Many students struggle in competitive programming not because they cannot code, but because they:

- Cannot recognize patterns in problems
- Do not know how to model a problem before coding
- Misjudge constraints and time complexity
- Make implementation mistakes due to poor planning

Existing platforms:
- Give problems
- Give solutions
- Do not train thinking step-by-step

---

## Target Users

Primary:
- Competitive programming students across multiple divisions
- USACO Bronze, Silver, and Gold students

Secondary:
- Beginners learning algorithmic problem solving
- Students preparing for programming contests

---

## Core Idea

Before coding, users should learn to:

1. Classify the problem type
2. Identify important variables and state
3. Choose appropriate data structures
4. Estimate time complexity
5. Consider edge cases

Algo-Coach will guide users through this process interactively.

## Phase 1 Features (Frontend MVP)

1. Problem Library
- Problems organized by division
- Metadata and tags
- Links to official statements

2. Lesson Mode
- Guided lessons teaching concepts and strategies
- Bronze lessons first, Silver and Gold later

3. Model-Before-Code Workflow
- Structured questions before hints or solutions

4. Hint Ladder System
- Progressive hints instead of immediate solutions

5. Drill Mode
- Short exercises to train pattern recognition

---

## Phase 2 Features (Backend)

1. User accounts
2. Progress tracking
3. Lesson completion history
4. Feedback collection
5. Testimonials

---

## Long-Term Vision

Algo-Coach becomes a structured system for learning competitive programming through guided reasoning, drills, and interactive lessons.

---

## Success Criteria

Phase 1 is successful if:
- Users can complete lessons end-to-end
- Lessons are clear and usable
- Platform structure supports expansion

Phase 2 is successful if:
- Users return and track progress
- Feedback improves lesson quality
